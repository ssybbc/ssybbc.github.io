# Discussing about the Project 3
Our rendered repo is [here](https://github.com/ViviFeathers/ST558-PROJECT-3/blob/main/Project_3_final.md), which is a nicely rendered repo.
Our repo is located [here](https://github.com/ViviFeathers/ST558-PROJECT-3), which has the outlined readme file including all five education categories.

## What would you do differently?
I would only enroll in one class (major) for one semester. For me, the more time I could spare to spend for the subject, the more confident I feel about it. during the process, I learned a lot from my partner and she helped me a lot with the prediction part. In the beginning, instead of log loss, I chose another way to assess the efficacy of the model and wasted a lot of time on it.

## What was the most difficult part for you?
Finding the right way to predict the responses was the most difficult part for me, as there are so many different methods and parameters to tune with. With different project goals and different nature of data type, different modeling methods are needed.

## What are your big take-aways from this project 
Could use data analysis to do prediction is one of the best thing I think will try implement in my own work area. For a common RNA-seq experiment, we could easily run 20-50 samples at the same time, thus use prediction modelling methods to find correlations betweeen different species of RNA. Let's say if we find the abundance of one species of mRNA is highly correlated with another mRNA species, there is enough reason to speculate those two mRNA may be at least co-regulated.
At least it could help me solve the mandarin taste problem that I used to use excel to solve.
